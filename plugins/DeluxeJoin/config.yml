# deluxejoin_formats:
#   <formatIdentifier>:
#     priority: <unique number here>
#     join_actions:
#     - '[JSONBROADCAST] {"text":"%player% joined the game","color":"yellow"}'
#     leave_actions:
#     - '[JSONBROADCAST] {"text":"%player% left the game","color":"yellow"}'
# ================
# The priority system is very important! It works just like
# the DeluxeChat format priority system. This allows players to
# have multiple permissions and DeluxeJoin will know what join/leave
# format to assign the player. 1 would be the highest priority (first)
# 1000 would be the lowest priority (last)
# 
# The permission node for a format is:
# deluxejoin.format.<identifier>
# 
# Placeholders are available if you have DeluxeChat or PlaceholderAPI installed on your server!
# You may use any placeholders anywhere inside of your formats.
# All placeholders are specific to the target player joining, leaving, or viewing the MOTD
# 
# If the MOTD system is enabled, it follows the same format as join/leave formats.
# You can create as many MOTDs you like, the player needs permission for a motd to
# view it. The permission node is:
# deluxejoin.motd.<identifier>
# 
# The following actions CAN NOT be used in leave_actions as the player has already left the server:
# JSON message, chat message, actionbar message, title message, player command, player sound
# 
# The following actions CAN NOT be used in motd_actions as these actions would affect all players online:
# JSON broadcast, chat broadcast, actionbar broadcast, title broadcast, broadcast sound
#
