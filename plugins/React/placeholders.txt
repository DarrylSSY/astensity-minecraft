# You can use the following suffixes for samplers
_raw -> Raw digits up to 9
_raw_0 -> Raw, no decimals
_raw_1 -> Raw, 1 decimal
_raw_2 -> Raw, 2 decimals
_raw_3 -> Raw, 3 decimals
_raw_4 -> Raw, 4 decimals
_raw_force_1 -> Raw, forces 1 decimal. If the value is round, places 0.
_raw_force_2 -> Raw, forces 2 decimals. If no decimal is set for any segment, zero is used. I.e. 19.00 (instead of 19)
