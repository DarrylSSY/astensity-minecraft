Version: 2.7 # Version of the config file. Don't change this value.

Features: # UseTeleportView can increase lags.
  UseTPS: true # Increase/Decrease view in function of server's TPS (Reduction Indice = 0)
  UsePing: true # The plugin will give a custom view distance for each players
  UseLoginView: true # Use a custom view on login
  UseAFKView: true # Use a custom view if the player is AFK.
  UseTasks: true # Use tasks. Turn this off will reduce lags, but view distance will change slower.
  UseFlyingView: false # Use a custom view if the player is flying.
  UseTeleportView: false # Use a custom view on teleport. Can reduce freeze on teleport.
  UsePermissions: false # Enable permissions (view.set.x) to bypass algorithm.
  UsePerWorldFeature: false # Enable per-world feature
  UsePerRegionFeature: false # Enable per-region feature (Only for 1.13.2+)

ViewDistance: # Adjust that according to your needs
  Min: 4 # Default minimum view distance (Minimum: 3)
  Max: 16 # Default maximum view distance (Maximum: 32)
  OnLogin: 4 # View distance on login
  OnAFK: 3 # AFK view distance (If UseAFKView is on true)
  OnTeleport: 4 # View distance on teleport (If UseTeleportView is on true)
  OnFlying: 12 # View distance if flying (If UseFlyingView is on true)
  MoreThanSettings: 0 # Add x chunks more than player's settings.

Delay: # Warning: A low value for SetViewDelay can increase lags and create ghost chunks!
  CalculationsDelay: 1 # Delay in seconds to actualize calculations
  SetViewDelay: 20 # Delay in seconds to actualize global view distance (Impact performances)
  UnsetTeleportViewDelay: 3 # Delay in seconds to unset the OnTeleport custom view (Impact performances)
  CheckFlyingDelay: 5 # Delay in seconds before set the OnFlying view distance
  AFKDelay: 90 # Delay in seconds before set the OnAFK view distance
  OnLoginDelay: 10 # Delay in seconds before the first OnLogin view change (Fixes invisible players issue)

Settings: # Calculations settings
  TpsLimit: 19.5 # Below: Decrease Reduction Indice || Over: Increase Reduction Indice.
  TpsChangeIndice: 0.01 # How much we had to increase/decrease the reduction indice. 0.01 = 1%
  MaxReductionIndice: 0.75 # Maximum Reduction Indice (0.75 = 75%)
  SafePing: 1 # Set this value to 0 for local hosting.
  PingForReduction: 550 # Ping required to decrease view distance
  PingForAugmentation: 90 # Ping required to increase view distance

Permissions: # Bypass settings
